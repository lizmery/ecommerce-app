# Ecommerce App

 A fully functional e-commerce shop where the products are only viewable by registered customers. This fullstack app features two separate dashboards based on the user role (customer vs admin). Customers can edit their profile, access the products page, purchase and download paid for products, and view all of their orders. Admins can add, edit, and delete products, delete and view all users, edit user roles, and view all customers and sales/orders.
